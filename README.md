# BCL-Cube
A 3D cube render in the console written in BCL (Ben's Compiled Programming Language).

Ben's Compiled Language is a programming language currently being developed by spidertyler2005, who is still in high school! This programming language is compiled to LLVM intermediate representation (IR) using Python and the llvmlite binding; the LLVM IR can then be compiled into binary executables. I had fun experimenting with BCL and creating this wireframe cube render in the console.
